## What Makes It AI-Optimized?

- **Explicit cross-references** to all other standards and documentation files.
- **Sectioned and labeled** for easy parsing and lookup by AI.
- **Tables and lists** for structured data extraction.
- **“AI Guidance” callouts** after each major section, telling the AI exactly how and when to use the information.
- **Citations and links** for scientific traceability.
- **Clear separation of research, tools, and implementation guidance.**
- **Summary tables** for quick lookup and code generation.

## What Could Be Further Improved?

### 1. **Add a “How AI Should Use This File” Section at the Top**

Make it explicit for the agent:
```markdown
## AI Usage Instructions

- When generating code, documentation, or analysis, always:
  - Reference the most relevant section of this file for scientific validation, tool choice, or parameter selection.
  - Cross-link to [DATA_STANDARDS.md](./DATA_STANDARDS.md) for implementation details, [DATA_DICTIONARY.md](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md) for field definitions, and [UI_STANDARDS.md](./UI_STANDARDS.md) for data visualization.
  - Cite the original research paper or tool in code comments and docstrings.
  - If a required resource or validation is missing, flag the gap and suggest an update to this file.
- When updating this file, log the change in the Feedback Log in DATA_STANDARDS.md.
```

### 2. **Add “AI Prompt Examples” Section**

Give the agent concrete prompt patterns:
```markdown
## AI Prompt Examples

- "Generate a feature extraction function for F0min using Praat, referencing RESOURCES.md §6 and DATA_STANDARDS.md §3.2.1."
- "Summarize the clinical validation for OpenSMILE eGeMAPS configuration, citing RESOURCES.md §3."
- "Update DATA_DICTIONARY.md with a new field for shimmer, using the normative range from RESOURCES.md §6."
- "Write a documentation summary for the menstrual cycle voice analysis research, referencing RESOURCES.md §2."
```

### 3. **Add a “Known Gaps/To-Do” Section**

This helps AI and humans know what’s missing and what to flag:
```markdown
## Known Gaps / To-Do

- No peer-reviewed studies for PMDD, PCOS, PMS, or endometriosis speech biomarkers (see Executive Summary).
- Need for more cross-cultural validation studies.
- Add links to new research as it becomes available.
- Update tool comparison as new versions are validated.
```

### 4. **Standardize “AI Guidance” Callouts**

Make sure every section ends with a clear, bolded “AI Guidance” block, e.g.:
> **AI Guidance:**  
> When generating code for [feature/tool], use the parameters and references in this section. Cite the original paper/tool in code comments and cross-link to DATA_STANDARDS.md and DATA_DICTIONARY.md.

### 5. **Explicitly State “Single Source of Truth”**

At the top, state:
```markdown
> This file is the single source of truth for all research, validation, and scientific justification in the Sage project. All code, documentation, and analysis must reference this file for scientific rationale.
```

## Final Checklist for AI-Optimization

- [x] Cross-references to all other docs
- [x] Sectioned and labeled for lookup
- [x] “AI Guidance” after every major section
- [x] Prompt examples for AI
- [x] Known gaps/to-do for future updates
- [x] Single source of truth statement
- [x] Tables and structured data for parsing
- [x] Citations and links for traceability

---

## TL;DR

- **You are 95% of the way there.**
- **Add a “How AI Should Use This File” section, prompt examples, and a known gaps/to-do section.**
- **Standardize “AI Guidance” callouts.**
- **Explicitly state this is the single source of truth for research validation.**

**With these tweaks, your RESOURCES.md will be maximally “AI-trainable” and future-proof for both agents and human collaborators.**

Let me know if you want me to apply these final optimizations!
