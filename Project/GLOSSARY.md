## Acoustic Feature Terms

- **Jitter**  
  Cycle-to-cycle variation in pitch (F0); high jitter may correlate with dysphonia or depressive symptoms.  
  *Implemented in `Sage/AnalysisService.swift`, see extraction parameters in `DATA_STANDARDS.md` section 3.1.*

- **Shimmer**  
  Cycle-to-cycle variation in amplitude; often elevated in stress and anxiety states.

- **Pitch / F0 (Fundamental Frequency)**  
  Perceived vocal pitch; can flatten in depression or fluctuate with hormonal cycles.

- **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)**  
  Spectral features modeling human auditory perception; useful in emotional and health-related speech analysis.

- **HNR (Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio)**  
  Measures voice periodicity; low values suggest breathiness or roughness.

- **Formants**  
  Resonant frequencies of the vocal tract; can shift in certain neurological or hormonal states.

## Project Concepts

- **Biomarker**  
  A measurable indicator of a biological condition (e.g., jitter as a proxy for mental health).

- **Speech Task**  
  A structured recording like sustained vowel or passage reading, designed to elicit analyzable voice features.

- **Sustained Phonation**  
  Holding a vowel sound ("aaa") for several secondsâ€”ideal for jitter/shimmer extraction.

## Technical Terms

- **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**  
  Practice of writing tests before implementation to ensure reliability.

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**  
  Architecture pattern used to separate business logic from UI.

- **AVAudioRecorder**  
  Apple API to record high-quality audio; used to capture speech samples in this app.
