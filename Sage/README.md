# Sage iOS App - File Organization

This document describes the file organization structure for the Sage iOS app, following industry best practices and clean architecture principles.

## 🏗 Architecture Principles

### Clean Architecture
- **Domain**: Contains pure business logic, independent of frameworks
- **Infrastructure**: Contains platform-specific implementations (Firebase, AVFoundation)
- **Features**: Contains UI and feature-specific logic

### Separation of Concerns
- **Models**: Domain entities and business rules
- **Services**: External integrations and data access
- **Views**: UI components and user interactions
- **ViewModels**: State management and business logic coordination

## 📋 File Organization Guidelines

### Domain Models
- Group related models by domain concept (User, Recording, Onboarding)
- Keep validators with their corresponding models
- Use protocols for shared interfaces

### Infrastructure Services
- Group by external dependency (Auth, Audio, Analytics, Uploading)
- Each service should have a single responsibility
- Use dependency injection for testability

### Features
- Each feature is self-contained with its own Views and ViewModels
- Features can depend on Domain and Infrastructure layers
- Features should not depend on other features directly

### Shared Resources
- **Constants**: App-wide constants like FirestoreKeys
- **Extensions**: Swift extensions for common functionality
- **Helpers**: Helper functions and utilities
- **Utilities**: Reusable utility classes like Logger

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### Recent Changes
- Moved from `Core/` to `Domain/` and `Infrastructure/`
- Renamed `DesignSystem/` to `UIComponents/`
- Created `App/` folder for application entry points
- Centralized constants in `Shared/Constants/`
- Added structured logging in `Shared/Utilities/`

### Benefits
- **Scalability**: Supports team growth and feature ownership
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Testability**: Clean architecture enables easy testing
- **Discoverability**: Intuitive file organization

## 🧪 Testing Structure

Tests mirror the main app structure:
```
SageTests/
├── AppFlow/                     # App-level tests
├── Authentication/              # Auth feature tests
├── Onboarding/                  # Onboarding feature tests
├── Recording/                   # Recording domain tests
├── Services/                    # Infrastructure service tests
└── Mocks/                      # Test mocks and stubs
```
