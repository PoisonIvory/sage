## Scientific Foundation

### Voice as a Digital Biomarker

The human voice serves as a rich source of physiological information, with recent research demonstrating its potential as a non-invasive biomarker for health monitoring¹. Voice production involves complex coordination between respiratory, laryngeal, and articulatory systems, making it sensitive to subtle physiological changes that may precede clinical symptoms².

**Key Physiological Mechanisms:**
- **Hormonal Receptors**: Sex hormone receptors (estrogen, progesterone, androgen) have been localized in laryngeal tissues³
- **Laryngeal Vascular Changes**: Narrow-band imaging studies demonstrate increased laryngeal vascular congestion during premenstrual periods⁴
- **Mucosa Alterations**: Estrogen increases laryngeal mucosa thickness and mucus production; progesterone causes laryngeal drying⁵

### Hormonal Impact on Vocal Tract

Recent clinical research has established clear connections between hormonal fluctuations and voice parameters:

#### Menstrual Cycle Correlations (2025 Research)
A longitudinal observational study by Kaufman et al. (2025) analyzed smartphone-collected voice recordings throughout complete menstrual cycles, revealing:
- Subtle but measurable variations in fundamental frequency (F0) correlating with menstrual phases
- Higher minimum pitch during late follicular phase (estrogen peak)
- Lowest voice intensity during luteal phase (progesterone dominance)
- No voice changes in hormonal contraceptive users, confirming endogenous hormone dependency⁶

#### PCOS and Voice Alterations
Research demonstrates significant voice changes in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome:
- **Laryngeal Abnormalities**: Impaired vocal fold vibration and incomplete glottic closure patterns⁷
- **Muscle Tension**: Supraglottic hyperfunction indicating deviant muscle tension patterns⁸
- **Symptomatology**: Increased reports of vocal fatigue, throat clearing, and perceived voice deepening⁹

#### Endometriosis Treatment Effects  
Voice changes occur in 5-10% of women treated with danazol (synthetic androgen) for endometriosis, causing measurable pitch deepening¹⁰. This establishes a direct causal relationship between hormonal interventions and quantifiable voice parameter changes.

### Clinical-Grade Acoustic Analysis

Sage implements validated acoustic analysis methods established in clinical speech pathology research:

#### Core Biomarker Parameters
**Fundamental Frequency (F0) Analysis:**
- Vibration rate of vocal folds, perceived as pitch
- Clinical range: 80-400 Hz for adult females
- Measured via autocorrelation algorithms (Praat implementation)
- Significance: F0 variability correlates with prosodic health and neurological function¹¹

**Voice Quality Metrics:**
- **Jitter**: Cycle-to-cycle F0 perturbation (<1% normal, >1.04% pathological)¹²
- **Shimmer**: Amplitude perturbation (<0.35 dB normal, >0.57 dB pathological)¹³  
- **Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio (HNR)**: Periodic vs. aperiodic energy (>20 dB healthy, <15 dB pathological)¹⁴

**Temporal Features:**
- Phonation duration (respiratory health indicator)
- Speech rate (cognitive and motor function marker)
- Pause patterns (linguistic processing efficiency)

#### Validation Against Clinical Standards
Our feature extraction pipeline implements algorithms validated against clinical gold standards:
- **Praat Compatibility**: Core algorithms replicate Praat voice report measurements
- **eGeMAPS Compliance**: Extended Geneva Minimalistic Acoustic Parameter Set features¹⁵
- **Multi-tool Validation**: Cross-validated against openSMILE and librosa implementations¹⁶

    // Given: User completes onboarding with valid 10-second recording
    let viewModel = OnboardingJourneyViewModel()
    viewModel.enhancedUserProfile.age = 28
    viewModel.enhancedUserProfile.genderIdentity = .woman
    
    // When: System processes voice recording for baseline
    let baseline = try await viewModel.establishVocalBaseline()
    
    // Then: Baseline metrics fall within clinical normal ranges
    XCTAssertTrue(baseline.biomarkers.jitter < 1.04) // Clinical threshold
    XCTAssertTrue(baseline.biomarkers.hnr > 15.0)   // Healthy voice quality
